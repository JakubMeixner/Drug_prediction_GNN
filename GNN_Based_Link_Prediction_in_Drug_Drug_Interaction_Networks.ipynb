        "Welcome! This colab serves as a tutorial for using Graph Machine Learning to perform Link Prediction in the drug-drug interaction dataset. Particularly, we focus on applying **GraphSage**, a type of **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**, to the `ogbl-ddi` dataset.\n",

We would strongly encourage you to make use of GPU runtime as you go through this notebook. Now, let's get started!\n",

We have learned about exploring graphs using NetworkX, setting up baseline GraphSage models for Graph Machine Learning in PyG, and learned a myriad of techniques to try to make them stronger: skip-connections, post-processing layers, neural link predictors, node feature augmentation, and even distance encoding/edge feature augmentation. We hope you learned a lot! As a parting gift, you can run the cell below to train our most reliable technique, the `NeuralLinkPredictor`, for 500 epochs and evaluate it on our test set. Beyond that, we encourage you to try mixing and matching different techniques in this Colab, or experimenting with your own!\n",
